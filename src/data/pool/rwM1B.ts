      correct: "A",
      explanation:
        "The Phoenix study showed that greater tree canopy correlated with lower temperatures even with similar building density, supporting the inference that tree coverage can mitigate heat island effects.",

      passage:
        "Philosopher John Rawls proposed a thought experiment called the \"veil of ignorance,\" in which individuals design a society's rules without knowing what position they will occupy in that society. Rawls argued that rational people behind this veil would choose principles ensuring basic liberties and arranging inequalities so that they benefit the least advantaged members of society. [The passage continues with critiques of Rawls's theory from libertarian philosophers who argue that the thought experiment ignores the importance of individual property rights.]",

        "Text 1: Educational researcher James Flynn has documented that standardized test scores have risen steadily across the twentieth century in virtually every country studied, a phenomenon known as the Flynn Effect. Flynn attributes this rise primarily to improvements in nutrition, healthcare, and the increasing complexity of modern environments, which demand more abstract thinking.\n\nText 2: Psychologist Russell Warne argues that the Flynn Effect does not necessarily indicate that people are becoming more intelligent in a meaningful sense. Warne points out that the gains are concentrated in specific subtests measuring abstract reasoning rather than in subtests measuring crystallized knowledge or practical problem-solving, suggesting the effect may reflect changes in test-taking familiarity rather than genuine cognitive advancement.",

      options: [
        "A) Modern environments have made people significantly smarter than previous generations.",

      passage:
        "Archaeological evidence from ancient Mesopotamia suggests that the development of irrigation systems along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers enabled early agricultural communities to produce food surpluses. These surpluses freed a portion of the population from farming, allowing the emergence of specialized occupations such as potters, weavers, and scribes. The resulting division of labor contributed to the growth of complex social hierarchies and, eventually, some of the world's first cities.",

        "A) Mesopotamian potters and weavers were more important to early civilizations than farmers.",
